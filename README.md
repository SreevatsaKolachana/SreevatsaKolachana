# 👋 Hi, I'm Sreevatsa Kolachana

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Engineering at NC State University, specializing in **ASIC/SoC Design**, **Design Verification**, **Physical Design**, and **Silicon Engineering**.

I'm passionate about building efficient and scalable hardware systems — from RTL design and verification to physical implementation and post-layout analysis. My work spans across the **front-end and back-end VLSI flow**, blending logic design, architectural thinking, verification coverage, and layout optimization to deliver high-performance digital systems.

---

## 🔧 Areas of Interest

- **ASIC & SoC Design** – RTL development, system-level integration, and functional correctness
- **Design Verification** – UVM-based environments, constrained random testing, coverage metrics
- **Physical Design** – Floorplanning, placement & routing, timing closure, and parasitic-aware optimization
- **Silicon Systems** – Power/performance/area (PPA) trade-offs, signal integrity, and post-layout simulation
- **Computer Architecture** – Pipelining, multi-core architectures, cache hierarchies, and memory systems

## 📂 Featured Projects

- [**128-bit Synchronous SRAM design at 3nm node**](projects/SRAMdesign_3nm/)  
  Ultra-high-speed SRAM design using GAAFET technology with full custom layout and post-layout simulation.

- [**Implementation of Transformer Self-attention mechanism for NLP applications using Verilog HDL**](projects/transformer-accelerator/)  
  Implemented a Verilog-based accelerator for NLP attention mechanisms using fixed-point computation and matrix multipliers.

- [**TCL-Driven RTL design and synthesis automation of 4-bit ALU**](projects/alu_rtl_synthesis/)<br>            An end-to-end RTL design project where I implemented a 4-bit ALU with FSM control, automated the synthesis flow using TCL scripting, and integrating SDC_based timing constraints.
  
- [**Functional Verification of I2C Multi-Bus Controller using System Verilog**](projects/i2c-verification.md)  
  Developed a layered SystemVerilog testbench for verifying an I2C master with Wishbone interface.
  
- [**Cache Hierarchy Simulator**](projects/cache-simulator/)  
  Simulated and optimized a two-level cache system with stream buffers and prefetching, analyzing access time and miss rate.

- [**Branch Predictor Simulator**](projects/branch-predictor/)  
  Designed dynamic prediction strategies (bimodal, gshare, hybrid) and evaluated misprediction rates using real benchmarks.

- [**Out of Order Processor**](projects/out-of-order-processor/)  
  Designed an out-of-order processor with 7 pipeline stages, instruction-level parallelism, and register renaming to improve throughput and reduce pipeline stalls.
