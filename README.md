# 👋 Hi, I'm Sreevatsa Kolachana

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Engineering at NC State University, specializing in **ASIC/SoC Design**, **Design Verification**, **Physical Design**, and **Silicon Engineering**.

I'm passionate about building efficient and scalable hardware systems — from RTL design and verification to physical implementation and post-layout analysis. My work spans across the **front-end and back-end VLSI flow**, blending logic design, architectural thinking, verification coverage, and layout optimization to deliver high-performance digital systems.

---

## 🔧 Areas of Interest

- **ASIC & SoC Design** – RTL development, system-level integration, and functional correctness
- **Design Verification** – UVM-based environments, constrained random testing, coverage metrics
- **Physical Design** – Floorplanning, placement & routing, timing closure, and parasitic-aware optimization
- **Silicon Systems** – Power/performance/area (PPA) trade-offs, signal integrity, and post-layout simulation
- **Computer Architecture** – Pipelining, multi-core architectures, cache hierarchies, and memory systems
