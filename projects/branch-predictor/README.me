# üß† Branch Predictor Simulator

## üìñ Project Description
This project is a **branch predictor simulator** that supports three types of predictors:
- **Bimodal predictor**
- **Gshare predictor**
- **Hybrid predictor** (chooser table selecting between bimodal and gshare)

The simulator takes a trace file of branch instructions (`PC address` and outcome) and predicts whether each branch will be taken or not. It tracks statistics such as total predictions, mispredictions, misprediction rate, and also outputs the final contents of the predictor tables.

This implementation models:
- Bimodal predictor with 2-bit saturating counters indexed by PC bits.
- Gshare predictor with an N-bit global history register and XOR-based index calculation.
- Hybrid predictor with a chooser table deciding whether to use bimodal or gshare per branch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Simulator
Before building, clean up any existing binaries:
```make clean```
